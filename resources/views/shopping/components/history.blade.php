                        &emsp;During this era Muay Thai became a national sport, developing the fundamental traditions that would remain the same for the next 400 years. The Mongkong (headband) and pa-pra-jiat (armband) were both introduced and the first “ring” was made by laying a rope on the ground in a square or circle as a designated fighting area.
                    <br>
                        &emsp;The fighters used hemp ropes and threads as hand coverings which wrapped around the hands and
                        forearms. A thick, starchy liquid would sometimes be used to bind the threads and make the striking
                        surface harder. Now, 400 years later, TWINS is Thailand’s #1 Muay Thai equipment manufacturer.
                     <br>
                        &emsp;In the first professional fights, fighters were not matched up by weight, height, experience or
                        age. There were no time limits on fights; they continued until there was a definite winner. Local
                        champions would represent their city or village, and often times fought on behalf of wealthy
                        businessmen
                        or royalty as a way for them to settle disputes. Losing a fight often resulted in the fighter and/or
                        businessman losing face. Gambling on Muay Thai matches was as popular then as it is now in stadiums
                        across the country.

                        &emsp;Muay Thai or Thai Boxing is the national sport and cultural martial art of Thailand. It was
                        developed several hundreds of years ago as a form of close-combat that utilizes the entire body as a
                        weapon.
                     <br>
                        &emsp;Today its definitive origins are debated by modern scholars, as much of the muay thai history
                        was
                        lost when the Burmese ransacked Ayudhaya, Siam’s capital city in Thailand, during the 14th century.
                     <br>
                        &emsp;Most written muya thai history was lost when the Burmese looted the temples and depositories of
                        knowledge held in Ayudhaya, and what volumes were saved are now national treasures that are preserved
                        and protected as documentation for Thai culture and heritage.
                     <br>
                        &emsp;In 1238 (Buddhist years), the first Thai army was created in the northern city of Sukhothai,
                        Siam
                        being its capital. The recorded history shows that a need to defend the capital city was spawned by
                        many
                        wars being fought between neighbouring tribes and kingdoms. The Siamese army was created to protect
                        the
                        government and its inhabitants within the city and surrounding villages. Soldiers were taught
                        hand-to-hand combat and how to use weapons, as well as how to use the entire body as a weapon. Their
                        training is what eventually evolved into Muay Thai and Krabi Krabong.
